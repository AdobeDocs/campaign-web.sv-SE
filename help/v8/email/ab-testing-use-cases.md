# Användningsexempel för innehållsexperiment {#content-experiment-use-cases}

<!--
This page provides practical examples and use cases for implementing content experiments with A/B testing in Adobe Campaign Web.

## Use case 1: Testing subject lines for promotional emails {#use-case-subject-lines}

### Scenario

Your marketing team wants to send a promotional email announcing a flash sale. They're unsure whether a direct discount message or a curiosity-based subject line will generate more opens.

### Experiment setup

**Goal**: Determine which subject line generates the highest open rate

**Treatments**:
* Treatment A: "FLASH SALE: 50% OFF Everything - Today Only!"
* Treatment B: "You Won't Believe These Prices... 😮"
* Treatment C: "Last Chance: Your Exclusive Discount Inside"

**Settings**:
* Audience size: 15% (to gather sufficient data quickly)
* Winning strategy: Best open rate
* Duration: 12 hours (sufficient for open rate analysis)
* Sending method: Automatic

### Why this works

Subject lines directly impact open rates, and testing three different psychological approaches (urgency, curiosity, exclusivity) helps identify which resonates best with your audience.

### Expected outcome

After 12 hours, you'll have clear data on which subject line style performs best, and the winning variant will automatically send to the remaining 85% of your audience.

## Use case 2: Optimizing call-to-action in email content {#use-case-cta}

### Scenario

An e-commerce company wants to increase click-through rates on their email campaigns. They want to test different call-to-action (CTA) button designs and copy.

### Experiment setup

**Goal**: Identify which CTA generates the highest click-through rate

**Treatments**:
* Treatment A: Blue button with "Shop Now"
* Treatment B: Orange button with "Get My Discount" 
* Treatment C: Red button with "Limited Stock - Order Now"

**Settings**:
* Audience size: 20% (larger sample for click behavior analysis)
* Winning strategy: Best click-through rate
* Duration: 48 hours (clicks accumulate slower than opens)
* Sending method: Manual (to review results before final send)

**Content differences**: 
* All treatments have identical content except for the CTA button color and text
* CTA buttons are placed in the same position in all variants
* Sender and subject line remain constant across treatments

### Why this works

Click-through rate is a key engagement metric, and CTAs are critical conversion drivers. Testing both visual elements (color) and copy helps optimize for action.

### Tips for success

* Keep all other elements consistent to isolate the CTA impact
* Use enough duration to gather sufficient click data
* Consider sending time: Weekdays often have different engagement patterns than weekends

### Expected outcome

After 48 hours, you'll see which CTA combination drives the most engagement and can manually send the winner after reviewing the full results.

## Use case 3: Optimizing sender credibility {#use-case-sender}

### Scenario

A B2B software company wants to improve their newsletter open rates. They suspect that the sender name might be impacting whether recipients open the email.

### Experiment setup

**Goal**: Determine which sender configuration generates the highest open rate

**Treatments**:
* Treatment A: From "Adobe Campaign Team" <campaign@adobe.com>
* Treatment B: From "Sarah Johnson, Adobe Campaign" <sarah.johnson@adobe.com>
* Treatment C: From "Adobe Marketing Updates" <marketing@adobe.com>

**Settings**:
* Audience size: 10% (smaller percentage since sender testing is lower risk)
* Winning strategy: Best open rate
* Duration: 24 hours
* Sending method: Automatic

**Content differences**: 
* Only the sender name and email address differ
* Subject line and content remain identical

### Why this works

Sender credibility significantly impacts open rates. Testing corporate branding vs. personal names vs. department identification helps understand audience preferences.

### Considerations

* Consider your industry context (B2B often responds better to personal names)
* Ensure all sender addresses are properly authenticated
* Test this periodically as audience preferences may evolve

### Expected outcome

You'll identify whether your audience responds better to:
* Branded company names (building brand recognition)
* Personal names (building relationship and trust)  
* Department-specific names (setting content expectations)

## Use case 4: Testing tone and messaging for different segments {#use-case-tone}

### Scenario

A luxury travel company wants to refine their communication style. They suspect that different customer segments may respond to different tones in email content.

### Experiment setup

**Goal**: Identify which content tone generates the highest engagement

**Treatments**:
* Treatment A: Formal, sophisticated tone - "Embark on an exclusive journey..."
* Treatment B: Adventurous, exciting tone - "Ready for the adventure of a lifetime?"
* Treatment C: Friendly, personal tone - "Hi [FirstName], we've found the perfect trip for you!"

**Settings**:
* Audience size: 25% (larger sample to capture diverse responses)
* Winning strategy: Best click-through rate (engagement with content)
* Duration: 36 hours
* Sending method: Manual

**Content differences**: 
* Headline and first paragraph tone
* Personalization approach
* Call-to-action wording

### Why this works

Tone and messaging style directly impact how recipients connect with your content. Different audience segments may have different preferences.

### Advanced tips

* Consider running this test separately for different customer segments
* Align the test with specific campaign goals
* Track not just clicks but also downstream conversions if possible

### Expected outcome

You'll learn which communication style best resonates with your luxury travel audience, allowing you to refine future campaign messaging.

## Use case 5: Reducing unsubscription rates {#use-case-unsubscribe}

### Scenario

A nonprofit organization has noticed increasing unsubscribe rates. They want to test different approaches to re-engagement content to minimize opt-outs.

### Experiment setup

**Goal**: Identify which approach generates the lowest unsubscribe rate

**Treatments**:
* Treatment A: Standard promotional content with multiple CTAs
* Treatment B: Impact-focused content with one clear CTA
* Treatment C: Story-driven content highlighting individual beneficiary stories

**Settings**:
* Audience size: 15%
* Winning strategy: Weakest unsubscription rate
* Duration: 72 hours (allow time for unsubscribe patterns to emerge)
* Sending method: Manual

**Content differences**: 
* Email structure and focus
* Number and type of calls-to-action
* Balance of donation asks vs. impact stories

### Why this works

Unsubscribe rate is an inverse metric that indicates content relevance. Testing different content approaches helps identify what keeps your audience engaged rather than what drives them away.

### Important considerations

* This metric requires more time to measure accurately (unsubscribes trickle in over days)
* Consider recipient fatigue - frequency may be more important than content
* Review unsubscribe feedback if available

### Expected outcome

You'll identify which content approach maintains audience engagement while minimizing opt-outs, helping preserve your email list health.

## Planning your experiments: Checklist {#experiment-checklist}

Before launching any content experiment, use this checklist:

**Define your objective**
- [ ] What metric are you trying to improve? (open rate, click rate, unsubscribe rate)
- [ ] Is this metric measurable within your chosen duration?
- [ ] Does this test align with broader campaign goals?

**Design your treatments**
- [ ] Are you testing only one variable at a time?
- [ ] Do you have 2-3 distinct treatments?
- [ ] Have you named treatments descriptively?
- [ ] Is each treatment different enough to potentially show meaningful results?

**Configure settings**
- [ ] Is your experiment audience size large enough? (generally 10-25%)
- [ ] Is your duration appropriate for your chosen metric?
- [ ] Have you selected the correct winning strategy?
- [ ] Do you need automatic or manual sending?

**Content preparation**
- [ ] Is content ready for all treatments?
- [ ] Have you previewed all variants?
- [ ] Have you sent test proofs?
- [ ] Are all links working correctly?

**Launch and monitor**
- [ ] Have you reviewed all settings one final time?
- [ ] Do you have a plan for monitoring results?
- [ ] Do you know when to check intermediate results?
- [ ] Have you documented your hypothesis for future learning?

## Tips for successful experiments {#tips-success}

### Statistical significance

* **Sample size matters**: Ensure your experiment audience is large enough to produce meaningful results
* **Duration is key**: Allow enough time for patterns to emerge, especially for click-through rate tests
* **Don't end too early**: Resist the temptation to call a winner before your planned duration unless one variant is dramatically underperforming

### Test design

* **One variable at a time**: Testing subject line AND sender AND content simultaneously makes it impossible to know what drove success
* **Meaningful differences**: Make your treatments different enough to potentially impact behavior
* **Document everything**: Keep records of your test setup, hypothesis, and results for future reference

### Audience considerations

* **Timing matters**: Consider when your audience is most likely to engage (day of week, time of day)
* **Segment smartly**: What works for one audience segment may not work for another
* **Respect frequency**: Don't test every email - save experiments for important campaigns

### Common pitfalls to avoid

* **Testing too many variants**: More treatments require larger audiences and longer durations
* **Ignoring mobile**: Preview all treatments on mobile devices
* **Overlooking deliverability**: Ensure all treatments follow email best practices
* **Making assumptions**: Let data drive decisions, not gut feelings
